    question_files_safe: Are my files safe?
    answer_files_safe: |
      Yes, your files are as safe as reasonable! The uploaded files are stored on
      the /tmp directory of the server for the time it takes to process them.
      Your resulting zip-file with the sorted activities is stored for a maximum
      of %1 minutes and has a 20 character long random hash string in its name. 
      To protect it from "guessing" the filename.
      When the shelf life of the file is over, it is deleted with the next request hitting the server. üßπ
    question_why_free: Why is this service free?
    answer_why_free: |
      I developed this service for myself to stay organized.
      And because it's basically only for that, I can share the code with others with a clear conscience.
    question_language_missing: Can I help adding my language?
    answer_language_missing: |
      Yes, you can help! If you want to add your language, please fork the project on GitHub and add your language to the i18n folder.
      Then create a pull request and I will review it as soon as possible. Thank you for your help! üôè
